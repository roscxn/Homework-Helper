# Lend a Helping Brain (Homework Helper)

Students may face some difficulties when doing homework or revision, and need a platform to answer to their queries. It can vary from a simple conceptual question to a challenging word problem. Receiving questions via private messaging applications can be rather intrusive. Tutors can make use of this shared platform to help their students instead. 

"Lend a Helping Brain" is an application that allows users to upload their questions, and also to help other users by providing solutions.
